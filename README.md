## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The game adapts to different screen sizes, providing a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Board Creation**: The board size and number of mines adjust based on the screen width, ensuring optimal gameplay.
- **Game Logic**: Includes functions to reveal tiles, mark tiles, and check for win/lose conditions.
- **User Interaction**: Click to reveal tiles and right-click to mark/unmark tiles, enhancing user engagement.
- **Visual Feedback**: Different colors indicate the status of each tile (hidden, mine, number, marked).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the game interface.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout, including responsive design with media queries.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, event handling, and DOM manipulation.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/minesweeper.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd minesweeper
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to play the game.

## Game Rules

1. The objective of the game is to clear a board containing hidden "mines" without detonating any of them.
2. Clicking on a tile reveals it. If it’s a mine, the game is over. If it’s a number, it indicates how many adjacent mines are present.
3. Right-clicking on a tile marks it as a potential mine.
4. The game is won when all non-mine tiles are revealed.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Graphics**: Implement better graphics and animations for a more engaging user experience.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Add options for different difficulty levels with varying board sizes and mine counts.
- **Leaderboard**: Implement a scoring system and leaderboard to track player performance.
- **Sound Effects**: Add sound effects for actions like revealing tiles and marking mines.
